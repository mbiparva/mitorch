# Medical Imaging in PyTorch (miTorch)
This package implements deep learning modules for medical imaging application in PyTorch.

The primary goal is to have a solid, readable, modular, reliable, extendable 
PyTorch package for medical imaging application in deep learning. 
The input is 3D volumes of various modalities. 

To name a few, the learning tasks are:
  * Segmentation:
     * Head-From-Brain (HFB) 
     * White-Matter-Hyperintensities (WMH)
  * Classification
  * Generative Networks
